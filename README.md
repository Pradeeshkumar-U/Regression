# **Salary Prediction using Regression Models 📊**  

A machine learning project by **Pradeeshkumar-U** that explores various regression techniques to predict salaries based on factors like **Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, and Years of Experience**.  

## **Models Used**  
✔️ **Multiple Linear Regression**  
✔️ **Polynomial Regression**  
✔️ **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
✔️ **Decision Tree Regression**  
✔️ **Random Forest Regression**  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- **Age**  
- **Gender**  
- **Education Level**  
- **Job Title**  
- **Years of Experience**  
- **Salary (Target Variable)**  

Example Data:  
| Age | Gender | Education Level | Job Title | Years of Experience | Salary |
|----|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| 32  | Male   | Bachelor's      | Software Engineer | 5   | 90000  |
| 28  | Female | Master's        | Data Analyst      | 3   | 65000  |
| 45  | Male   | PhD            | Senior Manager    | 15  | 150000 |
| 36  | Female | Bachelor's      | Sales Associate   | 7   | 60000  |
| 52  | Male   | Master's        | Director         | 20  | 200000 |

## **Objective**  
The goal is to compare different regression models to find the best approach for predicting salaries based on the given features.  

## **How to Run**
